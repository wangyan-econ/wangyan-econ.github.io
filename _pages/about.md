<br> Welcome to my website!

I'm an Assistant Professor in the School of Economics at Fudan University. I earned my Ph.D. in Economics from Nanyang Technological University in April 2024. 

My research interests lie in behavioral and experimental finance, with a particular focus on experimental asset markets and market microstructure.
