Welcome to my website!

I'm an Assistant Professor in the School of Economics at Fudan University. <br> I earned my Ph.D. in Economics from Nanyang Technological University in April 2024. <br> My research interests lie in behavioral and experimental economics, with a particular focus on experimental asset markets and market microstructure.
